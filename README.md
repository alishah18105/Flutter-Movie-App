# Movie App

Welcome to the **Movie App**! This app is built with **Flutter** and integrates various services like Firebase Authentication, Firebase Cloud Firestore, and the TMDb API to provide an interactive and seamless movie browsing experience.

## Features:
- **User Authentication**: 
  - We have implemented **Sign Up** and **Login** pages using **Firebase Authentication**.
  - User information, such as **email** and **name**, is stored securely in **Firebase Cloud Firestore**.

- **Trending & Popular Movies**:
  - The app fetches trending and popular movie data using the **TMDb API** to display them on the home screen.
  - Movie details such as titles, descriptions, tagline, and posters are displayed in a clean and user-friendly layout.

- **User Information Display**:
  - After the user logs in, their **email** and **name** are retrieved from **Firebase Cloud Firestore** and displayed in the **app drawer** for easy access.

- **Movie Trailers**:
  - The **Launch URL** package is used to open movie trailers directly in a browser or external player when the user taps on the trailer button.

- **State Management**:
  - We use **Stacked State Management** to ensure the appâ€™s state is managed efficiently, providing smooth navigation and data updates across screens.
